                    Before you set up the board, you need to choose who goes first. <br>
                    You can do this based on who won the last game, <br>
                    a coin toss, or by any other method. The person who will go first will take the black checkers and the other will take the white. <br>
                    <span class=paragraph-text-bold>Keep in mind that in checkers, the player with the black checkers always goes first</span>
